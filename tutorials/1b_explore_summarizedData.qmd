## Introduction

```{css, echo = FALSE}

  /* or try font-size: xx-large; */
}
```

In the previous tutorial (**Tutorial 1a**) we explored some of the
features of the CCLE and GDSC drug response datasets.

In contrast to the raw data which include the viability at each drug
concentration for each cell line, the summarized dataset contains
numerical summaries of each cell line's response to each drug over all
concentrations.

In this tutorial we'll first learn more about summary measures of drug
response, and then use scatterplots and correlation measures to assess
the agreement of these summary measures in the two studies.

## Summary Measures

In the summarized dataset, the cell line viability over all drug
concentrations has been summarized into a single number for each cell
line and drug combination.

This summary represents the *overall effect of the drug on the cell
line*.

There are many different ways this could be done. Our data includes two
summary measures that were used in the original studies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **IC50 (Half Maximal Inhibitory Concentration)**: the estimated
    concentration of the drug that will result in half (50%) of the
    cells surviving.

![](images/IC50.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Are cell lines with higher IC50 values more or less susceptible? What
about drugs with higher IC50 values - are they more or less toxic?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: despite the name, this is actually
    the area *above* the curve estimated by the drug concentration and
    viability data. Note that the estimation of this curve is not a
    simple task in itself - in the next tutorial we will explore how to
    summarize the relationship between two variables. (**Tutorial 2b**).

Are cell lines with higher values of AUC more or less resistant?

Are drugs with higher AUC more or less toxic?

## Setup Workspace

We start by loading the tidyverse family of packages and specifying a
default plotting theme for our `ggplot` graphics.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

## Load Summarized Dataset

Let's start by loading the `RDS` file containing the summarized
pharmacological data (including the IC50 and AUC values for each drug
and cell line combination, as described above).

```{r read-rds}
summarizedData <- readRDS(file.path("..", "data", "summarizedPharmacoData.rds"))
```

As we did with the raw data, we'll take a quick peek at this data before
getting started.

```{r peek-data}
str(summarizedData)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can count the number of cell lines and drugs in the data.

```{r count-uniq}
## with base R
length(unique(summarizedData$cellLine))
length(unique(summarizedData$drug))

## with the tidyverse
summarizedData |>
    summarize(nCellLines = n_distinct(cellLine),
              nDrugs     = n_distinct(drug))
```

Notice that there are `r nrow(summarizedData)` rows - each row here
corresponds to a cell line-drug combination. Making up these
combinations are 288 unique cell lines, and 15 drugs.

Was every cell line in the dataset tested with every drug?

## Comparing Studies using Plots

So we now have summary measures (IC50 and AUC) that indicate the
responses of cell lines to drugs. However, each study measured these
values separately. The goal of our analysis is to **investigate how well
these two studies agree with each other**. In other words, do the drug
response results in one study **replicate** in the other study?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### AZD0530

First, we'll examine this question for one of the drugs in particular:
**AZD0530**. To make our code easier to read, let's create a separate
object from for this subset of the data and call it `azdSummary`.

```{r one-drug-subset}
azdSummary <- subset(summarizedData, drug == "AZD0530")
```

We'll start out by visually exploring how the AUC values for AZD0530
compare in the two datasets using a scatterplot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r AUC-one-drug}
ggplot(azdSummary, aes(x = auc_GDSC, y = auc_CCLE)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 1/2) +
    xlab("GDSC AUC") +
    ylab("CCLE AUC") +
    ggtitle("AUC summaries of cell line response to AZD0530 across studies")
```

Perfect agreement between the GDSC and CCLE AUC values would mean all
the points falling on a straight line. How would you describe the level
of agreement between the AUC values for cell line response to AZD0530 in
the CCLE and GDSC studies? Does it seem like higher values of AUC in the
GDSC study correspond to higher values in the CCLE study?

> Place your answer here

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, let's look at the same type of scatterplot for the IC50 values.

```{r ic50-one-drug}
ggplot(azdSummary, aes(x = ic50_GDSC, y = ic50_CCLE)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 1/2) +
    xlab("GDSC IC50") +
    ylab("CCLE IC50") +
    ggtitle("IC50 summaries of cell line response to AZD0530 across studies")
```

What is different about this plot compared to the previous AUC plot?

> Place your answer here

------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, you may notice that there are many points with the highest value
of IC50 for CCLE. Recall from **Tutorial 1a** that this study measured a
fixed set of doses, regardless of how the cells responded, whereas in
the GDSC drug concentrations were increased if no response was observed.

What does this mean for the IC50 values in the CCLE? Are they more
likely to be too high or too low? Why?

> Place your answer here

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let's take a closer look at the axes.

-   There is a much larger range of IC50 values reported in the GDSC
    study, but most values are small.

This indicates a *skewed* distribution that may benefit from a
log-transformation. Next, we'll plot log10-transformed values of IC50.
We'll also plot *negative* values, so that increasing values of IC50
represent higher levels of drug toxicity (to make the plot more
comparable to the AUC plot).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r ic50-one-drug-log}
ggplot(azdSummary, aes(x = -log10(ic50_GDSC), y = -log(ic50_CCLE))) +
    geom_point(alpha = 1/2) +
    xlab("-log10(GDSC IC50)") +
    ylab("-log10(CCLE IC50)") +
    ggtitle("IC50 summaries of cell line response to AZD0530 across studies")
```

How would you describe the level of agreement between the IC50 values of
cell line response to AZD0530 in the CCLE and GDSC studies? Does it seem
like higher values of AUC in the GDSC correspond to higher values in the
CCLE?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### All Drugs

So far, we have only looked at how well the two studies agree for the
response measurements of a single drug.

However, we need to look at the rest of the drugs to fully assess the
level of replication.

First, we set out to reproduce Figure 2 in the Haibe-Kains paper, which
displays scatter plots of IC50 values for the 15 drugs that were probed
in both the CCLE and GDSC.

Essentially, we are going to make the plots from the previous section
for all 15 drugs at once and compare them side-by-side.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r ic50-all-drug-log}
summarizedData |>
    ggplot(aes(x = -log10(ic50_GDSC), y = -log10(ic50_CCLE))) +
    geom_point(alpha = 1/2, cex = 1/2) + 
    facet_wrap(~ drug) +
    xlab("-log10(GDSC IC50)") +
    ylab("-log10(CCLE IC50)") +
    ggtitle("IC50 summaries of cell line response across studies")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do the ranges of the axes not exactly match the axes in Figure 2 of
the published paper?

Note that the concentrations reported in the `summarizedData` dataset
are given in units of mili-molar. However, the plots contain values
calculated on the nano-molar scale (1 million times smaller). Thus, we
can reproduce the original plot's axis labels by scaling the
concentration values by 10\^6.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r ic50-all-drug-scaled}
summarizedData |>
    ggplot(aes(x = -log10(ic50_GDSC / 10^6),
               y = -log10(ic50_CCLE / 10^6))) +
    geom_point(cex = 1/2) + 
    facet_wrap(~ drug) +
    xlab("-log10(GDSC IC50/10^6)") +
    ylab("-log10(CCLE IC50/10^6)") +
    ggtitle("IC50 summaries of cell line response across studies")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compare this plot to Figure 2 in the Haibe-Kains reanalysis paper. Does
it seem to agree?

Looking at the IC50 values for both studies across all 15 drugs, would
you say that they tend to agree? Why or why not?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Comparing Studies using Correlations

We have visually inspected the agreement of the drug response data
between the two studies. Now, we'd like to go a step further and
**quantify** the agreement with statistics. We'll do this using measures
of correlation.

> If you aren't familiar with common measures of correlation (namely,
> Pearson and Spearman), don't worry! Check out the Supplementary
> Tutorial, **Supplement: Correlation Measures**, for a quick
> introduction!

Now we'll summarize different measures of correlation of the IC50 values
to assess the level of replication between these two experiments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, we'll compute the two different measures for correlating
continuous variables mentioned above (Pearson and Spearman correlation
coefficients).

1.  **Pearson's** correlation coefficient: measures the degree of
    *linearity* between continuous variables,

2.  **Spearman's** correlation coefficient: measures the agreement of
    the *rankings* between variables.

```{r ic50-correlation}
## with the tidyverse
drugCorrs <- summarizedData |> 
    group_by(drug) |>
    summarize(Pearson_ic50  = cor(-log10(ic50_GDSC / 10^6), -log10(ic50_CCLE / 10^6), method = "pearson"),
              Spearman_ic50 = cor(-log10(ic50_GDSC / 10^6), -log10(ic50_CCLE / 10^6), method = "spearman"))

drugCorrs
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, we'll visualize the correlations the IC50 measurements in a
grouped bar plot. To do this, we'll first have the reshape the data
using the `pivot_longer` function from the tidyverse.

```{r tidy-ic50-correlation}
## with the tidyverse
drugCorrs <- drugCorrs |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Pearson_ic50", "Spearman_ic50"), 
               names_to = "measure", 
               values_to = "correlation")

drugCorrs
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this "tidy" data, we can now plot the two correlation measures
across cell lines for each drug.

```{r barplot-correlations-ic50}
drugCorrs |>
    ggplot(aes(x = drug, y = correlation, fill = measure, group = measure)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(), colour = "black") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
    scale_fill_grey() +
    ylim(0, 1) + 
    ggtitle("Correlation of cell line IC50 summaries between studies for each drug")
```
