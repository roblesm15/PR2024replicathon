% Code of Conduct

We (the organizers and facilitators of the 2024 Replicathon at UPR-RP) are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone. This Code of Conduct is based on the [rOpenSci Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/).

We try to cultivate a community with shared values, where people are comfortable exploring ideas, asking questions, and saying things like "I don't understand" or "Why". Assume competence in the people you interact with. There are no stupid questions.

Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow community members.

Take care of each other. Alert one of the organizers or facilitators if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or a potential violation of this Code of Conduct, even if it seems inconsequential.

We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices
- unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, or employment
- sustained or willful disruption of discussions, talks, or other events
- deliberate intimidation
- continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
- unwanted photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
- pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- inappropriate physical contact without consent or after a request to stop
- stalking or following
- threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
- use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes
- unwelcome sexual attention
- deliberate 'outing' of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
- deliberate misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names
- publication of non-harassing private communication

We prioritize marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

- 'reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia'
- reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you"
- communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial
- criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, the Committee will take action that may include warning the offender or asking them to leave an event or an online channel either temporarily or permanently, or seeking help from law enforcement.

This Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the rOpenSci community, including rOpenSci staff and leadership. It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, the rOpenSci discussion forum, Slack, Community Calls, and in person at rOpenSci-hosted events or events officially endorsed by rOpenSci, including social gatherings affiliated with the event.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the facilitators as soon as possible. If any facilitator has a conflict of interest with a report, they will be recused and will not have access to the content or process of the report followup.
